		<p class="regular"> 
			A young girl named Eun-joo has gone missing in Busan in 1978. Without any contact from the kidnapper in the past two weeks and no further leads or clues, the police assume that she's dead. Eun-joo's desperate mother turns to renowned fortune-teller Kim Joong-san, who tells her that her daughter is still alive and that she can be saved if they enlist the help of veteran detective Gong Gil-yong. Despite his skepticism, Gil-yong accepts the case. When one of Joong-san's premonitions about the investigation comes true, Gil-yong begins to believe in his psychic abilities, and the two men team up in an unlikely partnership to find Eun-joo and bring her home.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster has two images of the two main characters. The man on the top looks like a detective who is wire tapping a phone call. The text next to him reads, "It must be confidential to save the child!" The man on the bottom is a shaman. The text next to him reads, "Detective Kong (the man on above) is the only person who has the fate to find the child." The text between the two man reads, "Detective in action, and a shaman helping with prophecy." Above the title of the movie, there's a tagline that says "True story in 1978," which makes the audience grow curious of how the shaman and detective will resolve the crime. However, the existence of shaman is not revealed on U.S. version of the poster at all. The image of family, shaman, and detectives is dark and intense. Although it says the movie is based on true story, the lack of shaman's presence in the poster does not help differentiating the movie from hundreds of other kidnapping movies.  </p>
