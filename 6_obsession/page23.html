		<p class="regular"> 
			Early in the Korean War in 1950 as the North is rolling through South Korea, South Korean privates Eun-pyo (Shin Ha-kyun) and Soo-hyeok (Go Soo) are captured during a battle and brought to North Korean captain Jung-yoon. Jung-yoon declaims to the prisoners that the war will be over in a week and that he knows exactly why they are fighting this devastating war, brother against brother. Afterwards he lets the prisoners go free, so that they can help reconstruct the nation after the war.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster focuses on the two main actors of the film. They are armed in military uniform. The text in the center of the poster reads, "year 1953, when the war was finished, it was not over in here." Rather than having the image of the two actors, the U.S. version of the poster has the names of the two on the top. The image in U.S. poster has the troops of soldiers who are getting ready to fire in a smoky atmosphere. The U.S. version is more successful at capturing the action and setting of the film.  </p>
