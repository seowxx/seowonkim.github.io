		<p class="regular"> 
			In 2000, an American military pathologist orders his Korean assistant to dump 200 bottles of formaldehyde down a drain leading into the Han River. Over the next several years, there are sightings of a strange amphibious creature in the waterway, and the fish in the river die off. A suicidal man, just before jumping into the river, sees something dark moving in the water.
			<br>
			<br>
			In 2006, a slow-witted young man named Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) runs a small snack-bar in a park near the River with his father, Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong). Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung); his sister Nam-joo (Bae Doona), a national medalist archer; and his brother, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), an alcoholic college graduate and former political activist.
			<br>
			<br>
			While Gang-du is delivering food to some customers, a huge creature emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people. Gang-du sees his daughter in the crowd and tries to grab her and run. As he realizes he has grabbed the wrong girl, he sees the creature snatching Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and quarantine people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is not only a direct danger, but also the host of a deadly, unknown virus.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster has image of the family who looks determined on the top. On the bottom is an image of River Han, which is the famous river that runs across Seoul, Korea. The white text in the center of the poster reads, "The family's struggle begins." The Korean title, if translated directly, is "Monster". However, there is no sign of monster in the Korean poster. The U.S. version of the poster has the image of monster grabbing a girl in school uniform. The U.S. version would be better to attract the audience by making them curious of the monster and how the girl will survive. </p>
