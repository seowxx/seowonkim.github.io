		<p class="regular"> 
			Set during the early Joseon Dynasty, the film begins with a concubine of the previous king (Park Ji-young) in a precarious position of having no blood ties to her step son, the current childless, widow king (Jung Chan). She schemes to replace him on the throne with her submissive young son Sung-won (Kim Dong-wook). Indifferent to his mother’s plans, the timid prince falls in love at first sight with Hwa-yeon (Jo Yeo-jeong), an aristocrat’s daughter, who has already found love with Kwon-yoo (Kim Min-joon), a low-born commoner. When her father (Ahn Suk-hwan) must send her to the royal palace as a concubine for the king, the two lovers try to elope but are caught after their first night together. Hwa-yeon agrees to enter the palace in exchange for saving Kwon-yoo's life.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> Both Korean and U.S. versions of the poster have erotic images. The setting is in early Joseon Dynasty, so everyone is wearing traditional Korean costume. The Korean poster has an image of the concubine with two men looking at her from front and back. The vertical text on the poster reads, "Dreadful palace. Sex with madness" The U.S. poster has an image of the concubine alone with her arms above as if she is inviting. Both of the posters are promoting sex, which is mostly the plot of the movie. However, the typography of the title in the Korean poster represents traditional Korean calligraphy better.  </p>
