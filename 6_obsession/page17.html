		<p class="regular"> 
			The movie opens on a river scene with children playing on the bank. The body of a girl in a school uniform floats by.
			<br>
			<br>
			Yang Mi-ja, a 66-year-old grandmother, consults a doctor at a hospital who is concerned about her forgetfulness, referring her to a specialist. As she leaves the hospital she sees a woman crazy with grief because her 16-year-old daughter has drowned.
			<br>
			<br>
			Though Mi-ja lives on government welfare, she has a small job taking care of a well-to-do elderly man who has had a stroke. At home, she cares for her ill-mannered 16-year-old grandson, Jong-wook (Lee David), whose divorced mother lives in Busan. When Mi-ja asks Wook about the girl from his class who drowned, Wook insists that he doesn't know her.
			<br>
			<br>
			When Mi-ja notices a poster advertising a poetry class at a local community center, she decides to enroll. The course assignment is to write one poem by the end of the month-long course. At the suggestion of her teacher, she begins writing notes about the things she sees, especially flowers.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster has closed up image of the actress. She is staring above as if she is reminiscing. The word 'poetry' becomes a single letter when translated to Korean. The typography used for the title in this poster is accurately capturing the lyrical value of the word itself. The US version of the poster has an image of the actress reading a book in a garden. The poster's design reminds me of the cover of a DVD rather than actual movie poster.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Spanish version of the poster also has an image of the actress that is similar to Korean poster. However, it is curious why the red brushstrokes are used to write the title. The red typography makes the film look like a horror film. Lastly, the U.K. version of the poster emphsizes five star ratings that the movie received. It also features the age rating in U.K. which is not usual to see in a movie poster. Overall, the Korean version is the most successful one to capture the sensitivity of the film through the image and typography.  </p>
